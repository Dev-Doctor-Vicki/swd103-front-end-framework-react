Welcome to to Front-End Foundations with Real World React. Let's see what the course will cover and what you'll learn.

## Why this course

Real World React will teach you how to successfully build web applications with modern frontend techniques, using the `ReactJS` library.

`ReactJS` (or simply React) is a popular UI library developed by Facebook and first published in May 2013. It allows for a modular and declarative approach to building user interfaces for web-based applications. It has grown very popular over the past few years and is one of the most sought after libraries to learn and use by new and upcoming developers.

However, React on its own is only one piece of the puzzle and it doesn't, out of the box, provide for some of the missing pieces of common frontend development. Pieces such as:

- Connecting to an API or external data source and retrieving data to power your app.

- Navigating around your app to different pages or areas.

- Managing the "`state`" of your application's data at a higher level (i.e. outside of components).

The problem is, these missing pieces are vital parts of any modern web application, as well as any realistic development scenario. It's key to understand both their concepts and how to approach them in React development. 

On completion of this course, you'll not only have a knowledge of modern React development, but also the skills required to build real-world apps that talk to real data.

You don't have to be a coding jedi or have years of experience as this course is designed for beginners. However, you should be familiar with the basics of frontend development, including `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. It would be helpful to have an understanding of basic concepts around RESTful APIs and how to interact with them, but it's not essential.

## Course topics

You'll join us on a deep dive into core React concepts. As you progress through this course, you will learn more about how React works, how you can use it to build complex web applications, and how to combine it with third-party libraries and frameworks to 'join the dots'. You will gain a detailed understanding of how you might use React in a real world setting.

## Part I

In part one of the course, we'll take an end-to-end approach to React. We'll start with taking a look at the library itself and the problems it solves, before moving on to topics such as Hooks and handling data from an API. Finally, we'll talk about how to build and deploy our application to a popular service such as Netlify.

Included in part one of the course are the following lessons:


- Lesson 1 - React JS: an introduction to React, a modern UI library.

- Lesson 2 - React Hooks: what they are and how to use them.

- Lesson 3 - Fetching data: using APIs in your code, and popular helper libraries such as Axios.

- Lesson 4 - Deploying your first app: using Netlify to deploy our app to the public.

Part II

In part two, we'll cover similar topics to the first part but take a deeper dive into them and look at some of the challenges we face as React developers and how to overcome them. We'll also learn about navigating around our application, and managing `state` across our application using `Redux` -- a common stumbling block for aspiring React developers.

The outline for part two of the course includes the following lessons:

- Lesson 5 - Thinking in React: structuring your projects, breaking functionality into components

- Lesson 6 - React Hooks deep dive: learn what each Hook does and how to use them

- Lesson 7 - Navigation in complex apps: moving users around different areas of your application

- Lesson 8 - State management in complex apps: using Redux and useReducer Hooks to manage app state

- Lesson 9 - The Dinosaur Search App: putting it altogether by building our very own application
